# High Issues

## H-1: `abi.encodePacked()` Hash Collision

abi.encodePacked() should not be used with dynamic types when passing the result to a hash function such as `keccak256()`. Use `abi.encode()` instead which will pad items to 32 bytes, preventing hash collisions: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/abi-spec.html#non-standard-packed-mode. (e.g. `abi.encodePacked(0x123,0x456)` => `0x123456` => `abi.encodePacked(0x1,0x23456)`, but `abi.encode(0x123,0x456)` => `0x0...1230...456`). Unless there is a compelling reason, `abi.encode` should be preferred. If there is only one argument to `abi.encodePacked()` it can often be cast to `bytes()` or `bytes32()` instead: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/30912/how-to-compare-strings-in-solidity#answer-82739. If all arguments are strings and or bytes, `bytes.concat()` should be used instead.

	```

</details>



## H-2: ETH transferred without address checks

Consider introducing checks for `msg.sender` to ensure the recipient of the money is as intended.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 185](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L185)

	```solidity
	    function withdrawFees() external {
	```

</details>



## H-3: Dangerous strict equality checks on contract balances

A contract's balance can be forcibly manipulated by another selfdestructing contract. Therefore, it's recommended to use >, <, >= or <= instead of strict equality.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 186](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L186)

	```solidity
	        require(address(this).balance == uint256(totalFees), "PuppyRaffle: There are currently players active!");
	```

</details>



## H-4: Weak Randomness

The use of keccak256 hash functions on predictable values like block.timestamp, block.number, or similar data, including modulo operations on these values, should be avoided for generating randomness, as they are easily predictable and manipulable. The `PREVRANDAO` opcode also should not be used as a source of randomness. Instead, utilize Chainlink VRF for cryptographically secure and provably random values to ensure protocol integrity.

	```solidity
	            uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.timestamp, block.difficulty))) % players.length;
	```

</details>



## H-5: Reentrancy: State change after external call

Changing state after an external call can lead to re-entrancy attacks.Use the checks-effects-interactions pattern to avoid this issue.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 123](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L123)

	State is changed at: `players[playerIndex] = address(0)`
	```solidity
	        payable(msg.sender).sendValue(entranceFee);
	```

	State is changed at: `_totalSupply++`
	```solidity
	        (bool success,) = winner.call{value: prizePool}("");
	```

</details>



# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 37](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L37)

	```solidity
	contract PuppyRaffle is ERC721, Ownable {
	```

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 195](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L195)

	```solidity
	    function changeFeeAddress(address newFeeAddress) external onlyOwner {
	```

</details>



## L-2: Unspecific Solidity Pragma

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 21](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L21)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.25;
	```

</details>



## L-3: Address State Variable Set Without Checks

Check for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 84](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L84)

	```solidity
	        feeAddress = _feeAddress;
	```

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 196](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L196)

	```solidity
	        feeAddress = newFeeAddress;
	```

</details>



## L-4: Public Function Not Used Internally

If a function is marked public but is not used internally, consider marking it as `external`.

<details><summary>3 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 101](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L101)

	```solidity
	    function enterRaffle(address[] memory newPlayers) public payable {
	```

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 118](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L118)

	```solidity
	    function refund(uint256 playerIndex) public {
	```

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 201](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L201)

	```solidity
	    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256) {
	```

</details>



## L-5: Literal Instead of Constant

Define and use `constant` variables instead of using literals. If the same constant literal value is used multiple times, create a constant state variable and reference it throughout the contract.

<details><summary>3 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 157](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L157)

	```solidity
	        uint256 prizePool = (totalAmountCollected * 80) / 100;
	```

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 158](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L158)

	```solidity
	        uint256 fee = (totalAmountCollected * 20) / 100;
	```

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 166](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L166)

	```solidity
	        uint256 rarity = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.difficulty))) % 100;
	```

</details>



## L-6: PUSH0 Opcode

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 21](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L21)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.25;
	```

</details>



## L-7: Loop Contains `require`/`revert`

Avoid `require` / `revert` statements in a loop because a single bad item can cause the whole transaction to fail. It's better to forgive on fail and return failed elements post processing of the loop

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 108](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L108)

	```solidity
	        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length - 1; i++) {
	```

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 109](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L109)

	```solidity
	            for (uint256 j = i + 1; j < players.length; j++) {
	```

</details>



## L-8: Dead Code

Functions that are not used. Consider removing them.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>

	```solidity
	    function _isActivePlayer() internal view returns (bool) {
	```

</details>



## L-9: Storage Array Length not Cached

Calling `.length` on a storage array in a loop condition is expensive. Consider caching the length in a local variable in memory before the loop and reusing it.

<details><summary>3 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 108](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L108)

	```solidity
	        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length - 1; i++) {
	```

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 109](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L109)

	```solidity
	            for (uint256 j = i + 1; j < players.length; j++) {
	```

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 136](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L136)

	```solidity
	        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; i++) {
	```

</details>



## L-10: Costly operations inside loop

Invoking `SSTORE` operations in loops may waste gas. Use a local variable to hold the loop computation result.

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 103](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L103)

	```solidity
	        for (uint256 i = 0; i < newPlayers.length; i++) {
	```

</details>



## L-11: State Variable Could Be Constant

State variables that are not updated following deployment should be declared constant to save gas. Add the `constant` attribute to state variables that never change.

## L-12: State Change Without Event

There are state variable changes in this function but no event is emitted. Consider emitting an event to enable offchain indexers to track the changes.

	```solidity
	    function withdrawFees() external {
	```

</details>



## L-13: State Variable Could Be Immutable

State variables that are only changed in the constructor should be declared immutable to save gas. Add the `immutable` attribute to state variables that are only changed in the constructor

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>
